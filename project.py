Amazing automation ideas that will help the world
Most of these ideas are mechanical and cannot be programmed by one person but still with hard work everything is possible
Here are some mind blowing ideas with the correct reference 

1)
 Geysers are important for everyday life , but sometimes we cannot switch on the geyser because of being in a meeting or any other reason
That is why we can create an app that will help us to switch on the geyser from our car
If you need more challenge , we can even add a feature to control the temperature and the intensity

2)
 On a hot day , an AC is very important especially for people driving in cars
 But most ACs start giving the cooling effect after 10-15 minutes and we cant wait that long
Thus we can create an app where we can switch on the ac in the car before even entering the car
This is going to be very useful for all of us
    
3)
Coffee is important for all of us , but it is too hechtic to go and make cofffee
By using our phone , we can make coffee in the coffee making machine by choosing the amount of milk and powder etc..
Thus we can create an app for the same

4)
Al of us forget to switch off the light when leaving the room and this wastes a lot of electricity
We can thus program a sensor to automatically dim the lights when the lights are on
The sensor will do this by seeing if any light energy and heat  is being produced or not and accordingly switch it off
